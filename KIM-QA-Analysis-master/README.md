# KIM-QA-Analysis
This repository contains codes used for KIM QA analysis using the 6 DoF robot. Three QA tests are performed to validate KIM's tracking accuracy and repeatability: 

1. Static localisation test
2. Dynamic localisation test
3. Treatment Interruption test

Details of the analysis procedure can be found in the attached document: KIM QA publication.pdf.

As different linacs have different couch shift conventions, the codes have been put in respective folders. See the instructions in respective folders.
